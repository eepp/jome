== Description

**jome** (joh¬∑mee) is a keyboard centric emoji picker desktop
application.

jome's sole purpose is to help you _pick_ an emoji. In other words,
it doesn't really care what you do with the chosen emoji afterwards:
you can leverage tools such as **xdotool**(1) to "`type`" it or
**xsel**(1) to copy it to the clipboard. See the
"`Type the accepted emoji`" section below and the **-c**{nbsp}option for
a starting point.

When you accept an emoji (with the keyboard or with the mouse), jome
prints the UTF-8 emoji or the Unicode codepoints (see the **-f**
option), with an optional prefix (see the **-p**{nbsp}option) for each
codepoint, to the standard output.

Additionally, jome can:

* Copy the UTF-8 emoji or the Unicode codepoints to the clipboard.
+
See the **-b**{nbsp}option.

* Execute a custom command which sends the UTF-8 emoji or the Unicode
  codepoints, with an optional prefix for each codepoint, as its last
  argument(s).
+
See the **-c**{nbsp}option.

* Send the UTF-8 emoji or the Unicode codepoints, with an optional
  prefix for each codepoint, in response to a client which requested
  picking an emoji.
+
See the "`Server mode`" section below.

If you close the window (you can press **Escape** or **Ctrl**+**C** to
do this), then jome prints nothing to the standard output, executes
nothing, and exits with status{nbsp}1.

If you don't start jome in server mode (**-s**{nbsp}option) and you
don't specify the **-q**{nbsp}option, then jome immediately exits
with status{nbsp}0 after you accept an emoji or close the window.

=== Graphical interface

There are four sections:

Find box (top)::
    Input box where you can type a query to find emojis.

Emoji grid::
    All emojis (with an empty find box) or find results.
+
When there's at least one emoji, there's always a selected emoji with a
square box around it.
+
Click an emoji to accept it. Press **Shift** when clicking to not print
VS-16 codepoints (see the **-V**{nbsp}option).
+
Hover an emoji to update the bottom emoji info text temporarily.
+
Make the background behind emojis dark with the **-d**{nbsp}option.
+
Hide the category labels with the **-L**{nbsp}option.
+
Hide the "`Recent`" category with the **-R**{nbsp}option.

Category list (right)::
    List of available categories.
+
When all emojis are viewed (the find box is empty), click a category
name to scroll to this emoji category.
+
The first category, "`Recent`", is a special category with the recently
accepted emojis.
+
Override the maximum number of recently accepted emojis with
the **-H**{nbsp}option.
+
Hide the "`Recent`" category with the **-R**{nbsp}option.
+
Hide the whole category list with the **-C**{nbsp}option.

Emoji info text (bottom)::
    Name, Unicode codepoints, Emoji standard version, and keywords of
    the selected or hovered emoji.
+
Hide the keyword list with the **-k**{nbsp}option.

=== Find emojis

The power of jome is its _find box_ (top).

When you launch jome, the find box is focused, and it should stay
focused unless you browse emojis manually with the intention of
accepting one with the mouse.

The format of a query is one of:

* __TERMS__
* __CAT__/
* __CAT__/__TERMS__
* __CODEPOINT__
* __CAT__/__CODEPOINT__

where:

__CAT__::
    Partial name of categories in which to find.

__TERMS__::
    Space-separated list of search terms.
+
For an emoji to be part of the results, its name and keywords
must contain ALL the searched terms.

__CODEPOINT__::
    A single Unicode codepoint using the standard **U**+__ABCD__
    notation.

Everything is case-insensitive.

=== Select and accept an emoji

To select an emoji, use the following keys:

**‚Üê**, **‚Üí**, **‚Üë**, **‚Üì**::
    Go left/right/up/down.

**Ctrl**pass:[+]**‚Üê**, **Ctrl**pass:[+]**‚Üí**::
    Go left/right five emojis.

**Page ‚Üë**, **Page ‚Üì**::
    Go up/down ten rows.

**Home**::
    Go to the first emoji.

**End**::
    Go to the last emoji.

To accept the selected emoji, press:

**Enter**::
    Accept the selected emoji with, if applicable:

Without the **-t** option:::
    No skin tone ("`yellow`").

With the **-t** option:::
    The default skin tone (value of **-t**).

**Shift**pass:[+]**Enter**::
    Like **Enter**, but do not print VS-16 codepoints.
+
See the **-V** option option.

**F1** to **F5**::
    If the selected emoji supports skin tones, accept the selected emoji
    with a light, medium-light, medium, medium-dark, or dark skin tone,
    overriding the **-t** option (if any).

**Shift**pass:[+]**F1** to **Shift**pass:[+]**F5**::
    Like **F1** to **F5**, but do not print VS-16 codepoints.
+
See the **-V** option option.

To cancel, press **Escape** or **Ctrl**pass:[+]**C**, or close the
window.

=== Go to Emojipedia page

To go to the https://emojipedia.org/[Emojipedia] page of the selected
emoji, press **F12**.

To go to the Emojipedia page of any emoji with the mouse, right-click it
and click "`Go to Emojipedia page`".

=== User-defined emoji keywords

You can either replace or augment the built-in list of keywords which
jome searches when you find emojis.

To set user-defined keywords, create an **emojis.json** file within
**pass:[~]/.config/jome/**.

**emojis.json** must contain a JSON object where keys are emojis and
values are objects. Each value may contain one of:

**keywords**::
    An array of keywords which replaces the built-in keywords entirely
    for this emoji.

**extra-keywords**::
    An array of keywords which augments either the built-in keywords or
    the keywords of the keywords entry for this emoji.

Example:

[source,json]
----
{
  "üçÅ": {
    "extra-keywords": ["canada", "laurentides"]
  },
  "üòÉ": {
    "keywords": ["yay", "hourra"]
  },
  "üö¨": {
    "extra-keywords": ["claude poirier"]
  },
  "ü´ö": {
    "extra-keywords": ["canada dry", "martin deschamps"]
  }
}
----

=== Server mode

jome features a server mode to avoid creating a process (a Qt window can
be quite long to create) every time you need to pick an emoji. With this
mode, you can view the jome window instantaneously.

To start jome in server mode, use the **-s**{nbsp}option to specify the
server name:

----
$ jome -s mein-server
----

This creates a local server named **mein-server**. On Unix, it creates
the socket file **/tmp/mein-server**.

[IMPORTANT]
====
On Unix, the server mode won't work if the socket file
already exists. Remove the file before you start jome in server mode:

----
$ rm -f /tmp/mein-server
$ jome -s mein-server
----
====

When jome starts in server mode, it doesn't show its window. Instead,
it waits for a command sent by the client, **jome-ctl**(1). To show the
window:

----
$ jome-ctl mein-server
----

When you accept an emoji, **jome-ctl**(1) prints what jome also prints
to the standard output and quits with exit code{nbsp}0. Therefore, the
options passed to **jome**(1) control the output
format of **jome-ctl**(1).

If you cancel jome (press **Escape** or **Ctrl**+**C**, or close the
window), **jome-ctl**(1) prints nothing and returns with exit
code{nbsp}1.

In server mode, jome doesn't quit once you accept an emoji or cancel: it
hides the window and keeps listening. To make it quits gracefully, which
also removes the socket file:

----
$ jome-ctl mein-server quit
----

You don't need to use what **jome-ctl**(1) prints to the standard
output. You can use jome in server mode with the **-c**{nbsp}option to
make jome execute a command itself. For example:

----
$ rm -f /tmp/mein-server
$ jome -s mein-server -c 'xdotool type'
----

Then, bind a keyboard shortcut to:

----
$ jome-ctl mein-server
----

=== Type the accepted emoji

Here are Bash scripts to type the accepted emoji with **xdotool**(1).

Direct mode:: {empty}

With **xdotool key**::: {empty}
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/bash

codepoints=$(jome -f cp -p U)

if (($? != 0)); then
    exit 1
fi

xdotool key --delay 20 "$codepoints"
----

With **xdotool type**::: {empty}
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/bash

emoji=$(jome)

if (($? != 0)); then
    exit 1
fi

xdotool type "$emoji"
----

Server mode:: {empty}

With **xdotool key**::: {empty}
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/bash

socket_name=jome.socket.$(id -u)

if [[ ! -e "/tmp/$socket_name" ]]; then
    jome -s "$socket_name" -n -w48 -f cp -p U & disown

    until [[ -e "/tmp/$socket_name" ]]; do
        sleep .1
    done
fi

codepoints=$(jome-ctl "$socket_name")

if (($? == 0)); then
    sleep .02
    xdotool key --delay 20 "$codepoints"
fi
----

With **xdotool type**::: {empty}
+
----
#!/usr/bin/bash

socket_name=jome.socket.$(id -u)

if [[ ! -e "/tmp/$socket_name" ]]; then
    jome -s "$socket_name" -n -w48 & disown

    until [[ -e "/tmp/$socket_name" ]]; do
        sleep .1
    done
fi

emoji=$(jome-ctl "$socket_name")

if (($? == 0)); then
    sleep .02
    xdotool type "$emoji"
fi
----

== Options

=== Output

**-f** __FMT__::
    Set the output format to __FMT__:

**utf-8** (default):::
    UTF-8 emoji.

**cp**:::
    Space-separated Unicode codepoints (hexadecimal).
+
Example: **1f645 200d 2642 fe0f**
+
Prepend a prefix to each codepoint with the **-p**{nbsp}option.

**-p** __PREFIX__::
    Set the prefix to be prepended to each Unicode codepoint with
    **-f**{nbsp}**cp**.
+
For example, with **-f**{nbsp}**cp** and **-p**{nbsp}**U+**:
+
----
U+1f645 U+200d U+2642 U+fe0f
----

**-n**::
    Do not print a newline after printing the emoji or codepoints.

**-V**::
    Do not print
    https://emojipedia.org/variation-selector-16[Variation Selector-16]
    (VS-16) codepoints.
+
VS-16 is a suffix codepoint which specifies that the preceding character
should be displayed with emoji presentation. For example, ‚ô• (which
predates Unicode emojis) followed with VS-16 becomes a red heart.
+
There are applications/fonts which don't like VS-16.

**-t** __TONE__::
    Set the default skin tone to __TONE__ instead of none:
+
--
**L**:: Light.
**ML**:: Medium-light.
**M**:: Medium.
**MD**:: Medium-dark.
**D**:: Dark.
--
+
The **F1** to **F5** keys still acept an emoji with a
specific skin tone.

=== Action

**-c** __CMD__::
    When you accept an emoji, execute the command __CMD__ 20{nbsp}ms
    after closing the jome window.
+
jome interprets __CMD__ like a shell does, so you can have arguments
too.
+
__CMD__ receives the UTF-8 emoji or the Unicode codepoints (depending on
the **-f** option) with their optional prefix as its last argument(s).
+
Examples with xdotool:
+
----
$ jome -c 'xdotool type'
$ jome -f cp -p U -c 'xdotool key --delay 20'
----

**-b**::
    When you accept an emoji, copy the UTF-8 emoji or the Unicode
    codepoints (depending on the **-f**{nbsp}option) to the clipboard.
+
WARNING: This uses **QClipboard** and is known not to always work,
depending on your window manager.

**-q**::
    Do not quit when you accept an emoji.
+
By default, when you accept an emoji (with the keyboard or with the
mouse), jome:
+
--
. Prints the accept emoji or its codepoints to the standard output.
. Hides its window.
. **Optional**: Copies the accept emoji/codepoints to the clipboard
  (see the **-b**{nbsp}option).
. **Optional**: Executes a command (see the **-c**{nbsp}option)
  after 20{nbsp}ms.
. If not running in server mode, quits (see the **-s** option).
--
+
With the **-q** option, jome doesn't hide its window and doesn't quit
when you accept an emoji so that you can make it print multiple emojis
and/or execute a command multiple time with multiple emojis without
restarting the application.
+
You cannot specify the **-q** and **-s** options together.

**-s** __NAME__::
    Start jome in server mode and set the server name to __NAME__.
+
On Unix, this creates the socket file **/tmp/**__NAME__ which must NOT
exist before you start jome.
+
You cannot specify the **-s** and **-q** options together.

=== User interface

**-d**::
    Use a dark background for emojis.

**-C**::
    Hide the category list.

**-L**::
    Hide the category labels in the emoji grid.

**-R**::
    Hide the "`Recent`" category.

**-r**::
    Include the recently accepted emojis in the results when
    finding emojis.
+
In this case, jome shows the recently accepted emojis first within the
result grid.

**-k**::
    Hide the keyword list.

**-w** __WIDTH__::
    Set the width of individual emojis to __WIDTH__ pixels, amongst
    16, 24, 32 (default), 40, or{nbsp}48.

**-P** __PERIOD__::
    Set the flashing period of the selection box to __PERIOD__{nbsp}ms
    (greater than or equal to{nbsp}32).
+
The selection box doesn't flash by default.

**-H** __COUNT__::
    Set the maximum number of recently accepted emojis to __COUNT__
    instead of{nbsp}30.

== Files

**pass:[~]/.config/jome/emojis.json**::
    User-defined emoji keywords.
+
See the "`User-defined emoji keywords`" section above.

== Exit status

**0** when you accept an emoji or **1** otherwise.
